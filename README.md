# Overview
DIYHub is a react application developed by Matthew Marberry and Ian Gornall.  DIYHub was developed as a place to provide the user with creations and inspirations.  DIYHub is an environment where users can go to share new DIY projects they are working on, or draw inspiration from previously posted projects.  DIYHub is a community that focuses on collaboration between its userbase - allowing users to provide feedback to one another, log their favorite projects and even collaborate with other users to build on the progress of posted projects.
